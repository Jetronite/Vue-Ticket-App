Excellent — here’s an **elaborate, professional README.md** tailored for your **Vue Ticket Management App**, perfectly aligned with your submission requirements and consistent with the React version you’ve already completed.
It’s clear, setup-ready, and submission-polished — you can drop it directly into your Vue repo root.

## 🧾 README.md – Ticket Management App (Vue.js Version)

### 🪶 Overview

The **Ticket Management App (Vue.js Edition)** is a complete front-end implementation of a ticket management system designed to test mastery in modern front-end architecture, UI consistency, and component-based design.
This version replicates the exact design and behavior of the **React** and **Twig** counterparts — ensuring full feature parity and a unified visual language across all frameworks.

Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) support tickets; manage authentication via simulated sessions; and experience a cohesive, responsive interface with accessibility and robust error handling.

### 🚀 Features Overview

| Feature                          | Description                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🏠 **Landing Page**              | A clean hero section with a wavy SVG background, decorative circles, and clear CTAs ("Login" / "Get Started").                     |
| 🔐 **Authentication**            | Includes Login and Signup screens with form validation, inline error messages, and localStorage-based session simulation.          |
| 📊 **Dashboard**                 | Displays live ticket statistics: total, open, and resolved tickets, pulled from localStorage.                                      |
| 🎟️ **Ticket Management (CRUD)** | Create, view, edit, and delete tickets with inline validation, success/error feedback, and persistent storage.                     |
| ⚙️ **Error Handling**            | Unified system for validation errors, unauthorized access, and failed data retrieval, with user-friendly toast or inline feedback. |
| 🧠 **Session Simulation**        | Uses `localStorage` key `ticketapp_session` to manage session state and protect restricted routes.                                 |
| 🖼️ **Responsive UI**            | Scales seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices (max-width: 1440px centered layout).                                  |
| ♿ **Accessibility**              | Semantic HTML, proper focus states, readable contrast, and keyboard-friendly forms.                                                |

### 🔑 Authentication Details

| Action        | Storage Key         | Description                    |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Session Token | `ticketapp_session` | Stores authenticated user data |
| User List     | `ticketapp_users`   | Holds registered users         |
| Tickets       | `tickets`           | Persists all ticket records    |

**Example Test User**

```json
{
  "email": "demo@ticketapp.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

To test, sign up directly via `/auth/signup` or pre-seed localStorage with the above user.

### 🧩 UI Component Summary

| Component             | Purpose                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HeroSection.vue**   | Wavy SVG hero banner with CTA and decorative circles.     |
| **FeatureBox.vue**    | Box-shaped info cards with shadow and rounded corners.    |
| **Navbar.vue**        | Responsive top navigation with session-aware links.       |
| **DashboardCard.vue** | Displays ticket statistics with color-coded statuses.     |
| **TicketCard.vue**    | Displays individual ticket info with Edit/Delete actions. |
| **TicketForm.vue**    | Handles create/edit operations with real-time validation. |
| **Footer.vue**        | Persistent footer with centered layout.                   |

---

### 🎨 Design System

**Layout Rules**

* Max width: **1440px**, centered.
* Consistent spacing via Tailwind’s padding/margin scale.
* Cards: shadow-lg, rounded-2xl.

**Status Colors**

| Status        | Color                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| `open`        | Green (`bg-green-500`)  |
| `in_progress` | Amber (`bg-yellow-500`) |
| `closed`      | Gray (`bg-gray-500`)    |

**Decorative Elements**

* Wavy SVG in hero section.
* Two circular elements across the site (CSS or SVG).
* Soft gradient backgrounds for section contrast.

---

### 🧱 State Management Logic

Since Vuex is overkill for this scale, state is locally reactive using Composition API.
Tickets are loaded from localStorage and reactive updates trigger DOM re-renders automatically.

---

### 🚨 Error Handling

**Invalid Form Input**
Displayed inline beneath affected fields (red text).

**Unauthorized Access**
Users attempting to access `/dashboard` or `/tickets` without an active session are redirected to `/auth/login` with a warning message.

**Failed Data Fetch / Network Error**
Fallbacks trigger toasts or inline “Failed to load tickets. Please retry.” messages.

---

### 🔒 Security Simulation

* Protected routes check for `ticketapp_session`.
* Logout clears the session and redirects to `/`.
* Sessions persist until manually cleared or user logs out.

---

### 📱 Responsive & Accessibility Notes

* Hero section and grid cards collapse vertically on mobile.
* Interactive elements maintain visible focus states.
* Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA compliance.
* Semantic elements (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`) ensure screen-reader compatibility.

---

### 🧭 Known Issues / Future Enhancements

* No real API integration — relies entirely on simulated storage.
* Toast notifications use inline implementations; could be replaced with Vue Toastification for production.
* Form validation is front-end only; no backend verification.
* Could extend priority and category filters for tickets.
